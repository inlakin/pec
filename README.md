## Privilege Escalation Checker

### Content

This repository contains several scripts I used during my OSCP journey for enumerating a target once I've obtained a first foothold on the target.

For Windows:  
	- **wipec.bat**  
(heavily inspired by [winprivesc](https://github.com/joshruppe/winprivesc))


For Linux:  
	- **lipec.bat**  
(heavily inspired by [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker/blob/master/linuxprivchecker.py))


Those tools are not yet finished.
